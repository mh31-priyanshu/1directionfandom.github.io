# One DIrection Fandom
It was my first project during my diploma on Web Page Designing. So i tried to make a fandom website for One Direction (One of the Best boy Band ever). I haven't used any Javascript in this project. I've used HTML and a unility framework of CSS called tailwind-css. I also tailwind-css very flexible, if that makes sense. Hit me up if you've any query or suggestion for my project.
