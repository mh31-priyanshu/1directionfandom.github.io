# One Direction Fandom
It was my first project during my diploma on Web Page Designing. So i tried to make a fandom website for One Direction (One of the Best boy Band ever). I haven't used any Javascript in this project. I've used HTML and a utility framework of CSS called tailwind-css. It makes development very flexible in making responsive pages (p.s this deployment  is not responsive :P i'll make it responsive in future updates ig), if that makes sense. Hit me up if you've any query or suggestion for my project. My gmail - lapkale0110@gmail.com ;)
